# What does SSL stand for?

Secure Sockets Layer

# which encryption is more secure to use?

Asymmetric encryption

# On server side which of the following file keeps the public keys of SSH clients who are allowed to SSH into the server.

~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# What is the main drawback of using symmetric encryption over asymmetric encryption?

In symmetric encryption the key used to encrypt the data needs to be sent to the server over the network which makes it less secure

# How do you create a legitimate certificate for your web server that web browsers can trust?

Get it signed by an authorized certificate authority

# How do you share the required details with certificate authority to get your certificate signed?


By sharing the CSR (certificate signing request) file with them

# How do browsers identify if the certificate is actually signed by the authorized certificate authority itself?


Browsers do have CA's public key built in whose respective private key is used to sign the certificate

# On jump host create an SSH public/private key-pair with name mykey at path /home/thor/.ssh/ (mykey and mykey.pub) for user thor

Run the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa`. In the next step specify the path and name of the key :-

thor@jump_host ~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa): /home/thor/.ssh/mykey
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
and keep other options to be default.

# Using the mykey SSH key-pair you created in previous question configure password less SSH connection between jump host and app01 for user thor. (thor user should already be there on both servers).


Note: There might be password less SSH connection between jump host and app01 for user thor but through default SSH keys, make sure to configure the same using the SSH key pair you created.

CheckCompleteIncomplete
Verify SSH key exists

Verify SSH access




Copy contents of /home/thor/.ssh/mykey.pub public key from jump host and add the same to /home/thor/.ssh/authorized_keys on app01 server.

OR

You can use this command directly:
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pub thor@app01

Certainly! Let's break down the command "ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pub thor@app01" in a simple way:

1. **ssh-copy-id**: This is a command used to copy your public SSH key to another computer so that you can easily and securely log in without a password.

2. **-i**: This is an option that specifies the identity file, which is your public key. In this case, it's "~/.ssh/mykey.pub," and it's like your digital key that you use to unlock the door.

3. **thor@app01**: This part tells the command where to copy your public key. "thor" is your username, and "app01" is the name or IP address of the remote computer you want to log in to.

So, when you run this command, you're telling your computer to copy your public key ("mykey.pub") to the "app01" computer for the "thor" user. After doing this, you can log in to "app01" securely without needing to enter your password every time because your key acts as a digital signature to prove that you're allowed to log in. It's like having a special key to unlock the door to your friend's house without them needing to give you the key every time you visit.

# Install openssl package on app01.

We need to SSH to app01 server and then we need to use command sudo yum install -y openssl to install the openssl package.

# On app01 create a CSR (certificate signing request) /etc/httpd/csr/app01.csr (key name should be app01.key). Below are the required details which should be used while creating CSR.


a. Country Name = SG

b. State or Province Name = Capital Tower

c. Locality Name = CT

d. Organization Name = KodeKloud

e. Organizational Unit Name = Education

f. Common Name = app01.com

g. Email Address = admin@kodekloud.com

h. Keep challenge password blank.

i. Keep optional company name blank.


cd into /etc/httpd/csr directory and run command sudo openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout app01.key -out app01.csr to generate a CSR file.

To verify the entries we used to create a CSR, run the command:

openssl req  -noout -text -in app01.csr
