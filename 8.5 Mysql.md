# If you have installed MySQL Server then you can find out MySQL root user password using command sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log But if you have installed MariaDB server you might have noticed that there is no password set for MySQL root user.


a. If you have installed MariaDB server then set password P@ssw0rd123 for root user.

b. If you have installed MySQL server then change root user password to P@ssw0rd123.


In case of MariaDB use below mentioned queries:

i. Login to mysql database server: - mysql -u root

and then run the following queries in it.

ii. USE mysql;

iii. UPDATE user SET password=PASSWORD('P@ssw0rd123') WHERE User='root' AND Host = 'localhost';

iv. FLUSH PRIVILEGES;



In case of MySQL use below mentioned queries:

i. Login to mysql database server: - mysql -u root -p

(enter password what you got from sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log command earlier)

and then run the following queries in it.

ii. SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('P@ssw0rd123');

iii. FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

# On app01 server since you have already installed MySQL/MariaDB server and its service is up and running so we created a database kk_db on it.


Login to mysql database server on app01 with password P@ssw0rd123 and identify how many tables kk_db database has.


Login to mysql:

mysql -u root -p

Password is - P@ssw0rd123

and check with queries:

USE  kk_db;

SHOW Tables;

# Create a MySQL user kk_user and set its password to S3cure#3214

Login to MySQL: mysql -u root -p

Password is - P@ssw0rd123

Use query: CREATE USER 'kk_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'S3cure#3214';

# Now we already have a database kk_db and a user kk_user. Grant full access on kk_db database to kk_user user.

Login to MySQL: mysql -u root -p

Password is - P@ssw0rd123

Use query: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON kk_db.* TO 'kk_user'@'localhost';
