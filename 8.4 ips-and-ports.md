# Run apache tomcat on all IP interfaces and port 9090 on host01 server.

Move to the /opt/ directory by using the cd command: -

thor@host01 ~$ cd /opt/


Then use the sudo at the beginning of the command because it needs root permission to execute this.

thor@host01 ~$ sudo sed -i 's/8080/9090/g' apache-tomcat-8.5.53/conf/server.xml 


Run the startup.sh script as follows: -

thor@host01 ~$ sudo ./apache-tomcat-8.5.53/bin/startup.sh 


Note: - Tomcat by default listen to all IP interfaces.

```ruby
thor@host01 /$ cd /opt/
thor@host01 /opt$ sudo sed -i 's/8080/9090/g' apache-tomcat-8.5.53/conf/server.xml

# We have cloned python app repo from GitHub in /opt/ directory in app01 server. When you start it which IP and port combination it will listen on?

Python app file : /opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py


Note: - Make use of the SSH command to login in app01 server from the thor user of host01 server. It's a passwordless setup.

thor@host01 ~$ ssh app01

hint: Run ssh app01 to login app01 server from the thor user of the host01 server as follows: -

thor@host01 ~$ ssh app01



After successful login, check app.run parameters in /opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py file with cat command as follows: -

# In app01 server ensure that our app in /opt/simple-webapp-flask/ run on port 5000 and listen to 127.0.0.1 IP.

Run python app in background with nohup.


Note:- Nohup stands for no hang up, which can be executed as shown below:-

nohup command-with-options &

Adding & at the end will move the process to run in background. When you execute a Unix job in the background (using &) and logout from the session, your process will get killed. You can avoid this with nohup.

hint:
ssh to app01 server and run below commands :-

`sudo sed -i 's/0.0.0.0/127.0.0.1/g;s/8080/5000/g' /opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py;`

`cd /opt/simple-webapp-flask/; nohup python app.py &`


```ruby
SSH to app01 server if you are in the host01 server from the thor user. It's a passwordless setup: -

thor@host01 ~$ ssh app01


Skip this step. if you are already in the app01 server.


Replace the given IP address and port with sed command as follows: -

[thor@app01 ~]$ sudo sed -i 's/0.0.0.0/127.0.0.1/g;s/8080/5000/g' /opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py


And inspect the changes: -

[thor@app01 ~]$ cat /opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py 


Now, move to the /opt/simple-webapp-flask/ directory: -

[thor@app01 ~]$ cd /opt/simple-webapp-flask/


Then run the python app in background with nohup as follows: -

[thor@app01 simple-webapp-flask]$ nohup python app.py &


To ensure it's working, make use of the curl command: -

[thor@app01 simple-webapp-flask]$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000


You will get a Welcome! message.

# From app01 server is apache tomcat of host01 accessible?
we started apache tomcat on all IP interfaces. Try curl host01:9090 on app01 server.

Yes! on host01's IP we can connect to tomcat

Yes! on host01's IP we can connect to tomcat

# From host01 server is Python flask of app01 server accessible?

We started python app on only 127.0.0.1 interface. Open an additional terminal and try curl app01:5000 on host01 server.


FIXME

```ruby
[thor@app01 simple-webapp-flask]$ curl app01:5000
curl: (7) Failed connect to app01:5000; Connection refused
[thor@app01 simple-webapp-flask]$ 
```


# Enable Flask app to be reachable from host01 and confirm by browser tab.


To make app reachable from outside we have to bind app to global IP that will be used to access it or simply listen on all interfaces. In this case please make Flask app listen on all IP interfaces

Note: - Make use of the SSH command to login in app01 server from the thor user of host01 server. It's a passwordless setup.

thor@host01 ~$ ssh app01

HINT
On app01 run sudo sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/g' /opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py

Restart flask app by running pkill python; cd /opt/simple-webapp-flask/; nohup python app.py &


SOLUTION
Make use of the SSH command to login in app01 server from the thor user of host01 server as follows: -

thor@host01 ~$ ssh app01
Skip this step if you are already in the app01 server. 


Replace the 127.0.0.1 IP address with 0.0.0.0 to make Flask app listen on all IP interfaces.

[thor@app01 ~]$ sudo sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/g' /opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py


Inspect the changes:-

[thor@app01 ~]$ cat /opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py 


Now, kill the running python app: -

[thor@app01 ~]$ pkill python


Move to the /opt/simple-webapp-flask/ directory: -

[thor@app01 ~]$ cd /opt/simple-webapp-flask/


And run the python app in the background with nohup command again: -

[thor@app01 simple-webapp-flask]$ nohup python app.py &


To ensure it's working, open an additional terminal and run the curl command from the host01 server as follows: -

thor@host01 ~$ curl app01:5000


You will get a Welcome! message.

# We added app01 IP address 172.16.239.30 to flask application but seems curl app01:5000 not working on host01 server. Please fix the issue so that curl app01:5000 works as well as curl 172.16.239.30:5000 works on host01 server.


Note: - Make use of the SSH command to login in app01 server from the thor user of host01 server. It's a passwordless setup.

thor@host01 ~$ ssh app01


NOTE:
app01 server have 2 IP interfaces with 2 IPs. We set app01 DNS non-resolvable IP 172.16.239.30 in flask app. Like previous lab we can again run flask app to listen on all IP interfaces by running sudo sed -i 's/172.16.239.30/0.0.0.0/g' /opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py; sudo pkill python; cd /opt/simple-webapp-flask/; nohup python app.py & and make it work for all IPs.

Try curl app01:5000 ; curl 172.16.239.30:5000 now on host01.

SOLUTION

Make use of the SSH command to login in app01 server from the thor user of host01 server as follows: -

thor@host01 ~$ ssh app01
Skip this step if you are already in the app01 server. 


Use the sed command to replace the IP address: -

[thor@app01 ~]$ sudo sed -i 's/172.16.239.30/0.0.0.0/g' /opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py
Now, kill the python process to rerun the app again: -

[thor@app01 ~]$ sudo pkill python


Move to the flask directory: -

[thor@app01 ~]$ cd /opt/simple-webapp-flask/


Run the python app in the background with nohup command: -

[thor@app01 ~]$ nohup python app.py &

And make it work for all IPs.

Finally, open an additional terminal and test it with the curl command on the host01 server as follows: -

thor@host01 ~$ curl app01:5000 
thor@host01 ~$ curl 172.16.239.30:5000


In both tests, you will get a Welcome! message.


```ruby 
[thor@app01 simple-webapp-flask]$ cd ~
[thor@app01 ~]$ sudo sed -i 's/172.16.239.30/0.0.0.0/g' /opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py
[thor@app01 ~]$ sudo pkill python
[thor@app01 ~]$ cd /opt/simple-webapp-flask/
[thor@app01 simple-webapp-flask]$ nohup python app.py &
[1] 1079
[thor@app01 simple-webapp-flask]$ nohup: ignoring input and appending output to ‘/home/thor/nohup.out’
curl app01:5000 
Welcome![thor@app01 simple-webapp-flask]$ curl 172.16.239.30:5000
Welcome![thor@app01 simple-webapp-flask]$ 
```
Sure, let's break down the command for you:

1. **`sudo`**: This is a special command that allows you to run the following command with superuser or administrative privileges. It's like getting permission to make important changes to the system.

2. **`sed`**: Sed stands for "stream editor." It's a powerful text-processing tool. It allows you to search for text patterns and make changes to them in files.

3. **`-i`**: The `-i` option tells `sed` to edit the file in place. This means the changes will be made directly in the file, rather than just displaying the modified text on the screen.

4. **`'s/172.16.239.30/0.0.0.0/g'`**: This is the pattern you want to search for and the replacement. It says, "Find all instances of '172.16.239.30' and replace them with '0.0.0.0'." The `g` at the end means it should replace all occurrences on each line. It's like doing a "find and replace" for a specific IP address in the file.

5. **`/opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py`**: This is the path to the file you want to modify. It specifies the location of the file on your system. In this case, it's `/opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py`.

So, when you run this command, it will use `sed` with superuser privileges to search for all occurrences of the IP address '172.16.239.30' in the file `/opt/simple-webapp-flask/app.py` and replace them with '0.0.0.0', and it will save the changes directly to the file. This can be useful for making configuration changes in a file, such as updating IP addresses.
