#  install NodeJS 14 on host01 server!

thor@host01 ~$ `curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -;sudo yum install -y nodejs`


The command you provided is used to install Node.js on a CentOS or RHEL-based system using the NodeSource repository. It consists of two parts:

1. **Adding the NodeSource Repository**:
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -
   ```
   This command downloads and runs a script from NodeSource that adds the Node.js repository to your system.

2. **Installing Node.js**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y nodejs
   ```
   After adding the repository, this command installs Node.js using the `yum` package manager.

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

- `curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_14.x` downloads the setup script from NodeSource.
- `|` pipes the script's output to the next command.
- `sudo bash -` runs the script with superuser privileges, which adds the NodeSource repository to your package manager.

After adding the repository, you use `sudo yum install -y nodejs` to install Node.js and its dependencies. The `-y` flag automatically answers "yes" to any prompts that may appear during the installation.

This command is useful for setting up Node.js on your system. However, please be cautious when running scripts from the internet with administrative privileges, as it's essential to ensure the source is trustworthy. NodeSource is a reputable source for Node.js, but always exercise caution when using this installation method.
